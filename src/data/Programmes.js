          'This PRM package includes LIVE INTERACTIVE PRM ONLINE SESSIONS, where students can ask their doubts in real time during the PRM classes. This PRM package is most suitable for students who study best in a classroom environment. Studying for difficult papers like PRM in isolation is often extremely daunting and, thus, when students study in a classroom type setup, they are better able to judge their progress by comparing it to that of other PRM students in their class. We at Midhafin have a high pass percentage when it comes to PRM exams and so PRM students are given various tried and tested approaches to both questions solving, as well as PRM exam strategy. ',
          'Other than the PRM live classes, the PRM students are given a variety of different tools that they might need for clearing the PRM exam. This includes our PRM doubt forum which is highly systematic and we make it a point that every question on the PRM forum is answered within reasonable time frame.',
