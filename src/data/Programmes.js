This CFA package is most suitable for students who study best in a classroom environment. Studying for difficult papers like CFA in isolation is often extremely daunting and, thus, when students study in a classroom type setup, they are better able to judge their progress by comparing it to that of other CFA students in their class. We at Midhafin have a high pass percentage when it comes to CFA exams and so CFA students are given various tried and tested approaches to both questions solving, as well as CFA exam strategy. ',
          'Other than the CFA live classes, the CFA students are given a variety of different tools that they might need for clearing the CFA exam. This includes our CFA doubt forum which is highly systematic and we make it a point that every question on the CFA forum is answered within reasonable time frame.',
          'Further, we provide CFA Mock tests, both sectional and full length, to aid the studying process of our students. This CFA package comes with monthly tests and 3 full length CFA mock papers which prepares students for the CFA exam. Our monthly tests are in line with our CFA study planner and allows students to constantly test their knowledge throughout the studying process.',
          'Another exclusive feature of this CFA package is the Customized Study Plan. We understand that different students have different strengths and time commitments and so we are against the idea of ‘one size fits all’. Students enrolling through this package would be provided with a customized study plan tailor-made to suit their individual learning needs.',
